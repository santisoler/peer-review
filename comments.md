# Review of "Paper title" by Paper Authors

**Paragraph 1:**
Brief description of what the paper is about.
This shows that I made the effort to carefully read and understand the paper.

**Paragraph 2:**
General comments on the quality of the submission and my overall thoughts.
Summarize major strengths and flaws.
**Be sure to say something positive!**

**Paragraphs 3+:**
More detailed analysis of specific issues: text organization, figures, methods,
results, and conclusions.
**Don't just point out problems, also include suggestions for solving them.**
Always give constructive feedback.

Specific things to check in the text;
* Use of English
* Structure of the paper
* Novelty
* Correctness of the method
* Is there enough detail in methods to reproduce findings?
* Are the conclusions backed by results?

Some comments about the figures:
* Is the resolution good?
* Is there any improper use of jet/rainbow color maps? If so, cite Niccoli
  (2014) and Rougier et al. (2014).
* Are all figures necessary?
* Are any essential figures missing?

Ask about source code and data availability if not mentioned in the text.
Cite journal requirements, if there are any.
Some templates for this:

**Geophysical Journal International:**

> Quoting from the GJI Data Policy document (https://academic.oup.com/gji/pages/General_Instructions):
>
>     GJI aims to make its papers more useful to the research community by asking
>     authors to provide supplemental material in digital form that will allow
>     others to use or reproduce their results.
>
> The document mentions that the supplemental material should include "The
> original data and the processing tools (programs and scripts) used to produce
> the results such that the research would become fully reproducible".

**Geophysics:**

> Quoting from the SEG Ethical Guidelines (http://seg.org/Publications/Policies-and-Permissions/ethical-guidelines):
>
>     A submitted manuscript should contain detail and reference to public
>     sources of information sufficient to permit readers to reproduce the work
>     or verify its accuracy.

*continued...*

> With the highly computational nature of current geoscience, fundamental
> sources of information required for reproduction of the work are the original
> data and the complete processing pipeline (source code, names and versions of
> programs, scripts, etc).
>
> Therefore, I ask that the authors provide their original data (as much as
> legally possible) and the required source code to reproduce their results.
> This is fundamental to ensure that others, specially the reviewers, can
> attempt to reproduce the findings in the paper.


Below I provide more detailed comments.

Sincerely,
