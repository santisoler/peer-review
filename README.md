# Template for a paper review

This is the template that I use when reviewing a paper: [`comments.md`](comments.md)

It has some reminders of things to which I should pay attention and some
boilerplate text for certain things (like asking for code and data).
I sign my reviews so I put in some reminders to always be civil and
constructive.

The template is written in Markdown but I generally submit it as plain text.
Optionally, you can add images and equations and convert it to PDF using
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

**Contributions are more than welcome**!
The template is licensed CC-BY, which means that you can reuse, share, and
modify it freely as long as you reference back to the original source (this
repository).
If you make any changes, please contribute those back so that I can use them as
well.
